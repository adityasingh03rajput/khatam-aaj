# Admin Panel Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. âœ… HTTP 409 Error - "BSSID already exists"
**Problem:** The same BSSID (ee:ee:6d:9d:6f:ba) was already in the default list  
**Fix:** Changed validation to check by network NAME instead of BSSID  
**Result:** Can now add multiple networks with same BSSID but different names

### 2. âœ… Database Persistence Added
**Created Models:**
- `BSSIDConfig.js` - Stores WiFi network configurations
- `Classroom.js` - Stores classroom-BSSID mappings

**Features:**
- Auto-saves to MongoDB when connected
- Falls back to in-memory storage if MongoDB unavailable
- Persists across server restarts

### 3. âœ… Student List Buttons
**Buttons Present:**
- "Refresh" - Reload student list
- "Clear All" - Remove all students

## How to Use:

### Add WiFi Network:
1. Enter Network Name (e.g., "Lab WiFi", "Classroom A")
2. Enter BSSID (MAC address)
3. Click "âž• Add Network"
4. Network appears in table

### Activate Network:
1. Find network in table
2. Click green "Activate" button
3. That BSSID becomes the authorized one
4. Status changes to ðŸŸ¢ Active

### Delete Network:
1. Find network in table
2. Click red "Delete" button
3. Network removed from list

## Database Connection:

### With MongoDB Running:
- All data persists in database
- Survives server restarts
- Console shows: "(saved to DB)"

### Without MongoDB:
- Uses in-memory storage
- Data lost on server restart
- Console shows: "(in-memory)"

## Restart Instructions:

### 1. Stop Current Processes:
```bash
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
taskkill /F /IM java.exe
```

### 2. Start Server:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### 3. Start Admin Panel:
```bash
cd "admin panel"
run.bat
```

## Testing:

1. Add a network with name "Test WiFi" and any BSSID
2. Click Activate on it
3. Check server console - should show activation
4. Refresh admin panel - should show ðŸŸ¢ Active status
5. Go to Students tab - buttons should be visible

## Notes:

- The default "Main WiFi" network is always present
- You can have multiple networks with the same BSSID
- Only ONE network can be active at a time
- Active network determines which students can connect
